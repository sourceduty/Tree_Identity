[Tree Identity](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-jd1xcKJm1-tree-identity) was developed to help users identify tree species by analyzing images of tree leaves or by using detailed descriptions provided by the user. Using advanced image recognition capabilities, Tree Identity can compare leaf shapes, sizes, colors, and other distinctive features to known tree species to provide a likely match. When images are not available, it guides users through a step-by-step, multiple-choice process to collect key information about the leaf's characteristics, such as its shape, margin, and arrangement, to narrow down the possibilities.

In addition to identifying tree species, Tree Identity also provides insights into the growth patterns of different tree species. By understanding species-specific growth rates and the impact of various environmental factors—such as soil type, climate, and light exposure—it can offer estimates on how fast a tree might grow. This information can be useful for individuals interested in planting trees or monitoring the growth of existing ones in their landscape.

While Tree Identity can provide useful guidance on tree species identification and growth, it is not equipped to make definitive statements about the health of a tree. For detailed assessments, especially concerning tree health issues, Tree Identity encourages users to consult a professional arborist or a plant health specialist. This ensures that users get accurate and reliable information, especially for critical decisions regarding tree care and maintenance.
